# video_player_pi2

moving on from webapps for a bit, started to look at pygame with a view to learning its control system and very basic functions.

seems a quite elegent way of doing graphics development on pi (excluding 3d from what I can see).

this is a video player, partly done that should suit me better than Kodi did, being far too flabby for its own good.

control cycle is very basic, using a variable MODE for mode, from a list of MODES with static values, stolen code from adafruit as noted therein.
